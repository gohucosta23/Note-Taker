## Installation
<br>
<p>This app counts with the super powers of a server on the back end. We are using Node.js, Javascript and a library called Express to simplify the server process. In order for the application to run properly the server needs to be initialized. The user can fork or clone this repo, go to their command line and initialize the server typing "node server.js". They will receive a message on their command line console saying the server is listening and the PORT number. Then from there they will be able to access the app on their browser on "http://localhost:7000/".</p>
